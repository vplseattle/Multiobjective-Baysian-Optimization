Multiple Objective Optimization work for optimizing aptamer binding to new targets done in collaboration with Chris Knight and Josh Knowles

CLADE: Closed Loop Aptameric Directed Evolution

Closed loop aptameric directed evolution, (CLADE) is a technique enabling simultaneous discovery, evolution, and optimization of aptamers. 
(Platt et al, 2009)

The technique was developed in the Kell group, and was an EPSRC-funded project.
